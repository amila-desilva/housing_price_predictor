# Housing Price Predictor
This project serves as method to learn the github workflow, packages like poetry, PEP 8 conventions, and many other industry standards for and around Python and Data Science. This project will be an example of how I would be expected to work and contribute, as a Data Scientist at a large company.

## The Circle Class
The `Circle` class is a toy class. It serves only as a placeholder for Python code that might appear in a .py file. As this project progresses, the `Circle` class will be deleted.

### Circle Class Methods
`Circle.diameter(radius)` - The `diameter` method of the circle class expects one argument, the `radius` of the circle, and returns the diameter.
