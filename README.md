Prerequisites Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.11 Poetry for dependency management Installation Fork the Repository:

Fork this repository to your GitHub account. Clone the Repository:

Clone the forked repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/housing_price_predictor.git cd housing_price_predictor Install Dependencies:

Use Poetry to install the project dependencies: poetry install Activate the Poetry Environment:

Activate the Poetry virtual environment:

poetry shell Running the Application To execute the application, follow these steps:

Navigate to the Project Directory:

cd housing_price_predictor/housing_price_predictor Run the Main Script: Execute the main script:

python main.py Running main.py
To run the main.py script, execute the following command in your terminal:


python main.py
Expected Output
Since the dummy_method currently doesn't perform any operations or produce output, running main.py will not generate any visible output. The script serves as a placeholder for future development.

Running Tests
To run the test suite for your main.py script, follow these steps:

1. Set the Python Path
Ensure that the project root is included in the Python path. This can be done by running the following command before executing your tests:

bash code
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)
This command sets the PYTHONPATH to the current working directory, which is typically the project root.

2. Run the Tests
Use pytest to run the tests:

bash code
pytest
This will execute the test cases defined in your test files (e.g., test_main.py). Since the dummy_method returns None, all tests should pass, verifying that the method doesn't throw any errors with various types of input.

export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) Execute Tests Using Poetry:

poetry run pytest Expected Output: The results will indicate whether the tests passed or failed.
